<h1>Coffee Roasting Notes</h1> 
	<p>The following roasts were all completed in a cheap popcorn roaster purchased from target on special for AU$4.<br>
	Essentially this is a heating element and a fan, with the inlets directed around the roasting chamber creating a hot vortex, that heats and stirs the beans.  <br> 
	Volumes need to be kept relatively small to prevent clogging up and preventing  the beans from circulating freely.
		
<h2>09/04/15</h2>
		<p> 75g <b>No timer</b> No Stirring<br> 
			Excessive chaff - roast stopped part way. Future roasts to be done outside!!</p>
	
<h2>10/04/15</h2>
	<h3>First batch</h3>
		<p> 75g <b>2:45</b> No Stirring<br>
			Slightly darker than first, still a little underdone. Consistency of roast not fantastic.</p>
	
	<h3>Second batch</h3>
		<p> 75g <b>3:30</b> Stirred <br>
			Beans agitated with wooden spoon to try to give better roast consistency. <br>
		First crack took mch longer than the first due to the agitation.<br>
		Slight improvement in consistency. <br>
		Still tasted green after sitting over a week. </p>

<h2>10/05/15</h2>
	<h3> First Batch</h3>	
		<p> 75g <b>3:30</b> No Stirring<br>
			Crack very widely spaced out. Very inconsistent roast.</p>

	<h3> Second Batch </h3>
		<p> 40g <b>3:30</b> No Stirring<br>
			Big improvement in mixing. Much more consistent roast. Very Dark. <br>
			Palatable, sweet aroma. Some oils lost from the bean, transferred onto paper used as label, suggesting slightly overdone. </p>
	
	<h3> Third Batch </h3>
		<p> 40g <b>3:00</b> No Stirring<br>
			Similar consistency to Second batch. Roast depth midway between First and Second batches.<br>
			Strong charred flavour. Perhaps from buildup of oil from previous roasts? </p>
	
	<h3>Fourth Batch</h3>
		<p>26g <b>2:45</b> No Stirring<br>
			Mix up with scales. Wrong weight measured out. Very similar to third batch. </p>
		
		
<h2> To Test next:</h2>	
		<p> Clean oil from roaster and try again at around third batch settings. </p>
